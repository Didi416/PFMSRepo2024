// Pointers are essential to C++ and are used to store the memory address of another variable.
// They are declared by using the asterisk (*) before the variable name.
// The data type of the pointer must be the same as the data type of the variable you're storing the address of.
// When passed as a parameter to a function, the function can modify the value of the variable by using the pointer.

int main () {

    // Ex01
//    * Assign to variable x (of type double) the value 41012
    double x = 41012;
    std::cout << "x = " << x << std::endl;

//    * Use a pointer ip to point to x (why type is ip?)


//    * Print the value of what ip is pointing to
//    * Print the value of ip

//    * Make variable y a reference to x (what type is y?)

//    * Print the value of what y is referencing to

//    * Create a double z of value 1

//    * Use pointer ip to point to z

//    * Assign z the value 100

//    * Print the value of what ip is pointing to
//    * Print the value of x
//    * Print the value of y
//    * Print the value of z
